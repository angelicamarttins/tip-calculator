## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript recursive functions

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my HTML and CSS skills, especially GRID Layout and how to create classes which will be add dinamically with JavaScript. 

Beyond that, this is my very first project using JavaScript. I researched a lot to complete this challenge, improved my logical thinking and my understanding of algorithms. 

### Continued development

I'll continue to pratice my JS skills in order to write better clean code and to pratice OOP and functional programming.
